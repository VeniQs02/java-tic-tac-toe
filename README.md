**Overview**:
This is an old project of mine, that I tried to improve upon.
Younger-me-mistakes were fixed, code was refactored and a few new functionalities were added.

**Improvements**:
> Its designed to catch any errors, as well as user missinputs. Even if the user persists with wrong inputs, the app will be functional.

> Using correct types, and access modifiers for best application performance and encapsulation.

> The board can be any size the user desires, and also there are a customizable number of players using different symbols.
If the user insists on using the default 3x3 X-O preset, then he should create a new object of TicTacToe with parameter of 'true'

**Gameplay**:

**Usage**:
Having Board.java and TicTacToe.java in the same package, we can create a new object of TicTacToe() with a boolean parameter
depending whether we want the default game settings or not.
